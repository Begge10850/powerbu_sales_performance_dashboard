# 📊 Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard Project

This project explores a retail sales dataset through end-to-end data analysis, transformation, and visualization. The goal was to extract actionable business insights and present them in an interactive Power BI dashboard suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🧠 Project Summary

I used **Databricks** to clean and analyze raw sales data through SQL and Python. After transforming the dataset, I exported it to **Power BI** to create a dynamic and professional dashboard with multiple pages, including:

- Executive Sales Summary
- Market Performance Overview

The final dashboard was published on **Power BI Service (My Workspace)**, making it accessible online.
